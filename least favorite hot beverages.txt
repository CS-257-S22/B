Jonas: Marmite
Kai: The LDC and Burton hot chocolate when it's out of hot chocolate powder and you press the button to get some hot chocolate and it gives you a spurt of actual hot chocolate so you think "maybe this time it's actually giving me hot chocolate" but it isn't the rest is just scalding water and you put cream in it just to feel something but you don't and it encapsulates the feeling of disappointment in a way that few other things can.
Cole: Boiling Poo
Tin: Hot Burbon
